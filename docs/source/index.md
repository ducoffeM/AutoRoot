***AutoRoot*** : Differentiable Root Solvers for Cubic and Quartic Polynomials
AutoRoot is a fast, fully differentiable PyTorch library for solving cubic and quartic equations

AutoRoot serves as a standalone and versatile solution for anyone needing to solve polynomial equations of degrees 3 to 4 with *PyTorch*. This library leverages classical algebraic methods, specifically **Cardano's method** for cubic equations and **Ferrari's method** for quartic equations, to provide accurate and fully differentiable root solutions. The differentiability allows for seamless integration into PyTorch's autograd system, making it ideal for applications requiring gradient-based optimization and neural network integration.
