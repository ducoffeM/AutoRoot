# Installation


## Prerequisites

### Python 3.9+ environment

The use of a virtual environment is recommended, and you will need to ensure that the environment use a Python version
greater than 3.9.
This can be achieved for instance either by using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or by using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (or [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) on windows)
and [venv](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/venv.html) module.

The following examples show how to create a virtual environment with Python version 3.10.13 with the mentioned methods.

#### With conda (all platforms)

```shell
conda create -n do-env python=3.10.13
conda activate do-env
```
